## Features
- **Command Deck HUD** – Track Stardust, Stellar Energy, and Research Data with animated resource telemetry.
- **Multi-resource economy** – Balance extraction, energy production, and research throughput with a living simulation.
- **Industrial Wings** – Deploy drones, refineries, reactors, orbital arrays, quantum labs, and megastructure forges.
- **Deep upgrade tree** – Unlock strategic research that reshapes manual extraction, global production multipliers, and late-game megastructures.
- **Mission log** – Real-time narrative beats and operational updates keep you informed of pivotal events.
- **Energy-aware simulation** – Facilities throttle dynamically when reserves run low; offline progress preserves up to 12 hours of gains.
- **Modern UX** – High-fidelity visuals, responsive layout, and status feedback designed for desktop and mobile.
  
## Roadmap
- Narrative-driven prestige loop with multi-star sectors.
- Strategic events and dilemmas that influence production priorities.
- Additional megastructures with unique interactive minigames.
- Cloud saves and leaderboards for long-term campaigns.
